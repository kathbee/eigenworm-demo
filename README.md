# eigenworm-demo
This is a very basic implementation of the 'eigenworm' processing laid out in Stephens et al., PloS Comp Bio, 2008. 
You'll need to install Python (Anaconda recommended), as well as several Python libraries to run it. 
The 'eigenworm-demo.ipynb' file has the code we worked on together in behavior subgroup 4/13/2020. I will add a file 
with a 'complete' implementation after people have a chance to take a crack at the incomplete implementation.
